# ComfyUI utility nodes

A collection of miscellaneous utility nodes for ComfyUI

# Nodes

## MU_JinjaRender
You can use this node to evaluate a string as a Jinja2 template. Note, however, that because ComfyUI's frontend uses `{}` for syntax, There are the following modifications to Jinja syntax:

- `{% %}` becomes `<% %>`
- `{{ }}` becomes `<= =>`
- `{# #}` becomes `<# #>`

### Functions in Jinja templates

The following functions and constants are available:

- `pi`
- `min`, `max`, `clamp(minimum, value, maximum)`,
- `abs`, `round`, `ceil`, `floor`
- `sqrt` `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`. These functions are rounded to two decimals


In addition, a special `steps` function exists.

The `steps` function will generate a list of steps for iterating. 

You can call it either as `steps(end)`, `steps(end, step=0.1)` or `steps(start, end, step)`. `step` is an optional parameter that defaults to `0.1`. It'll return steps *inclusive* of start and end as long as step doesn't go past the end. 

The second form is equivalent to `steps(step, end, step)`. i.e. it starts at the first step.
